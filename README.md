# sum-of-four-squares

LAGRANGE: Decomposing a non-negative integer into a sum of at most four squares.
for original description of the algorithm.
please @see https://schorn.ch/lagrange.html.
There is no C version, So I have to rewrite the algorithm using C.

# Usage

1. copy decompose.h and decompose.c into the project.
2. chagne REPS in decompose.h as needed.

# Test

@see main.c
